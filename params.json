{"name":"Sepomex","tagline":"A REST API for the SEPOMEX database","body":"# [Sepomex](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/sepomex)\r\n\r\nSepomex is a REST API that maps all the data from the current zip codes in Mexico. You can get the CSV or Excel files from the [official site](http://www.sepomex.gob.mx/lservicios/servicios/CodigoPostal_Exportar.aspx)\r\n\r\nWe build this API in order to provide a way to developers query the zip codes, as we had faced the problem if importing data like this in many projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Table of contents\r\n- [Quick start](#quick-start)\r\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\r\n- [Heroes](#heroes)\r\n- [License](#license)\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nThe URL to start consuming the JSON response is under:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://sepomex-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/zip_codes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are currently `145,481` records on the database which were extracted from the [CSV file](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/sepomex/blob/master/lib/support/sepomex_db.csv) included in the project.\r\n\r\nRecords are paginated with **50** records per page.\r\n\r\n### Running the project\r\n\r\nTo run the api locally you can follow the next steps:\r\n\r\n1. First clone the project `git clone https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/sepomex.git`\r\n2. Under the `sepomex` directory run the `bundle install` command to download all the dependencies\r\n3. Set up the `database.yml` to meet your requirements and create it\r\n4. Migrate the database, `rake db:migrate`\r\n5. We have provided a rake task to migrate the CSV data: `rake db:migrate:zip_codes`\r\n6. Lift the server `foreman start` or `bundle exec rackup config.ru`\r\n7. The path for the api is: `/api/v1/zip_codes`\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease submit all pull requests against a separate branch. Please follow the standard for naming the variables, mixins, etc.\r\n\r\nIn case you are wondering what to attack, we hnow have a milestone with the version to work, some fixes and refactors. Feel free to start one.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## Heroes\r\n\r\n**Abraham Kuri**\r\n\r\n+ [http://twitter.com/kurenn](http://twitter.com/kurenn)\r\n+ [http://github.com/kurenn](http://github.com/kurenn)\r\n+ [http://klout.com/#/kurenn](http://klout.com/#/kurenn)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\nCode and documentation copyright 2013-2014 Icalia Labs.
